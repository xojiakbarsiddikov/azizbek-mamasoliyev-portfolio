                    From an early age, I found myself drawn to the world of business. Growing up, I often observed my family running a small business, and I became fascinated with the way decisions were made, how products were marketed, and how relationships were built with customers. These moments sparked a curiosity in me, one that has only grown stronger with time. I remember asking myself, “How do businesses thrive? What makes some companies successful while others struggle?” It was this curiosity that set me on the path to understanding how the world of business works and why it is such an exciting and impactful field.
<br/>
<br/>
During high school, my interest in business deepened. I eagerly signed up for business-related courses, where I first encountered concepts like marketing, economics, and organizational behavior. A turning point came when I participated in a business competition where I was asked to develop a business plan from scratch. The experience was a real eye-opener, as I had to dive into research, create strategies, and present my ideas to a panel. It was both exhilarating and overwhelming, but it helped me realize the complexities and creativity involved in business management. It also gave me the confidence to know that business wasn’t just a career path—it was something I genuinely enjoyed and was good at.
<br/>
<br/>
To gain hands-on experience, I started looking for internships and part-time jobs. I worked with a local business, where I assisted with daily operations and learned about inventory management, customer relations, and basic accounting. These experiences taught me how businesses run on a day-to-day basis and showed me the importance of being organized and adaptable. I also had the chance to work with a team, where I quickly learned that good communication and collaboration were key to achieving any goal.
<br/>
<br/>
As I continued to explore the business world, I decided to take a leap and start my own small venture. I launched an online store, selling handmade products, and it was a valuable lesson in entrepreneurship. Through trial and error, I learned about marketing strategies, customer feedback, and even the financial side of running a business. While it wasn’t without its challenges, this project reinforced my passion for business and gave me a taste of the rewards that come from building something from the ground up.
<br/>
<br/>
One of the proudest moments of my high school journey was winning a local business competition. It wasn’t just the prize that meant the most, but the validation that my ideas and hard work could truly pay off. This achievement inspired me to keep pushing forward and to pursue a future where I could continue to innovate and make an impact.
<br/>
<br/>
What excites me about your university is the way it blends practical business skills with creative thinking. The chance to learn from experienced professors, collaborate with like-minded peers, and engage in real-world projects is exactly what I’m looking for. I’m especially interested in courses that focus on entrepreneurship and strategy, as I believe they will help me refine my skills and prepare me for a future where I can lead businesses to success.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I’m ready to take the next step in my journey and pursue a degree in Business Administration. I look forward to immersing myself in the academic environment, learning from the best, and challenging myself to grow. My ultimate goal is to use the knowledge I gain to start and lead businesses that create lasting value, not only for their customers but for the communities they serve. For me, this isn’t just about building a career—it’s about making a meaningful difference in the world through business.
